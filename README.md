# Cloud Vision Objective-C Sample

This app demonstrates how to use the [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) to run label and face detection on an image.

# Additions
This version automatically captures images of your surroundings and speaks the tags that come back for the image, and then recursively repeats itself for the lifetime of the app.

## It is admittedly sloppy, I was just experimenting and wanted to share the code.
